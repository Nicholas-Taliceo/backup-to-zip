# backup-to-zip

*Author*: Nicholas P. Taliceo
*Date*: 01 August 2017

## Purpose

To create a Python script that allows for an input directory and copies all folders and files in said folder and creates a compressed ZIP file in an output directory.

Inspiration for this script is to backup an external harddrive to a cloud-based storage system. Of course, this will also work for specific file paths, or general harddrives.

## Details

- Utilizes Python 3
- 

## Usage

1. Open backup_to_zip.py in a Python 3+ IDE. Run this script.
2. The first parameter is the **directory to be saved**. 
  ..-Input the pathname *exactly* as it appears in Windows Explorer.
3. The second parameter is the output path, aka, **where the ZIP file will be saved.**
