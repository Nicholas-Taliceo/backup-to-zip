# Backup to ZIP Scheduling Instructions
The overall goal of the backup_to_zip.py file is to allow the script to automatically run without user interference. This means that we ultimately *don't want* to open Python every time the computer reboots; we also don't want to input several parameters.

Rather, it would be preferable to find a way to *program* this script to start and execute at a particular time, with little or no user interference.
